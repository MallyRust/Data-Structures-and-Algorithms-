### Graphs
#### Glosary

- A **graph** G is defined as an ordered set (V,E), where V(G) represents set of vertices(nodes) and E(G) represents the edges that connect these vertices.
- **Adjacent and neigbors** - two vertices are adjacent/neigbors if there is an edge connecting them
- **Degree of node** - is the total number of edges containing the node. If deg(u) = 0, it means that u does not belong to any edge and such a node is known as an isolated node.
- **Size of a graph** - the total number of edges in it.
- **Path** - a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices.
- **Closed Path** - A path P is known as a closed path if the edge has the same end-points. That is, if v0 = vn.
- **Simple path** -  A path that repeats no vertex, except that the first and last may be the same vertex.
- **Cycle** -  A path in which the first and the last vertices are same. 

**Regular graph** - graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors. That is, every node has the same degree.

Graphs can be **undirected** and **directed**:

In an **undirected graph**, edges do not have any direction associated with them. So,nodes can be traversed from A to B as well as from B to A.

In a **directed graph**, edges form an ordered pair. If there is an edge from A to B, then there is a path from A to B but not from B to A.

**Connected graph** a graph is said to be connected if for any two vertices (u, v) in V there is a path from u to v. That is to say that there are no isolated nodes in a connected graph.

**Complete graph** A graph G is said to be complete if all its nodes are fully connected. That is, there is a path from one node to every other node in the graph. A complete graph has n(nâ€“1)/2 edges, where n is the number of nodes in G.

**Labelled graph or weighted graph** in a weighted graph, the edges of the graph are assigned some weight or length.

**Multiple edges** distinct edges which connect the same end-points. 

**Loop** an edge that has identical end-points is called a loop.

**Multi-graph** a graph with multiple edges and/or loops is called a multi-graph.

#### Terminology of a Directed Graph:
- **Out-degree of a node** - the out-degree of a node u, written as outdeg(u), is the number of edges that originate at u.
- **In-degree of a node** - the in-degree of a node u, written as indeg(u), is the number of edges that terminate at u.
- **Degree of a node** - the degree of a node, written as deg(u), is equal to the sum of in-degree and out-degree of that node. 
Therefore, `deg(u) = indeg(u) + outdeg`
- **Isolated vertex** - A vertex with degree zero. Such a vertex is not an end-point of any edge.
- **Pendant vertex** (also known as leaf vertex) - a vertex with degree one.

#### Representation of graphs:
- Sequential representation by using an adjacency matrix.

- Linked representation by using an adjacency list that stores the neighbors of a node using a linked list.
