### Graphs
#### Glosary

- A **graph** G is defined as an ordered set (V,E), where V(G) represents set of vertices(nodes) and E(G) represents the edges that connect these vertices.
- **Adjacent and neigbors** - two vertices are adjacent/neigbors if there is an edge connecting them
- **Degree of node** - is the total number of edges containing the node. If deg(u) = 0, it means that u does not belong to any edge and such a node is known as an isolated node.
- **Size of a graph** - the total number of edges in it.
- **Regular graph** - graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors.
