### Graphs
#### Glosary

- A **graph** G is defined as an ordered set (V,E), where V(G) represents set of vertices(nodes) and E(G) represents the edges that connect these vertices.
- **Adjacent and neigbors** - two vertices are adjacent/neigbors if there is an edge connecting them
- **Degree of node** - is the total number of edges containing the node. If deg(u) = 0, it means that u does not belong to any edge and such a node is known as an isolated node.
- **Size of a graph** - the total number of edges in it.
- **Path** - a finite or infinite sequence of edges which joins a sequence of vertices.
- **Closed Path** - A path P is known as a closed path if the edge has the same end-points. That is, if v0 = vn.
- **Simple path** -  A path that repeats no vertex, except that the first and last may be the same vertex.
- **Cycle** -  A path in which the first and the last vertices are same. 

**Regular graph** - graph where each vertex has the same number of neighbors. That is, every node has the same degree.

Figure below shows regular graphs

Graphs can be **undirected** and **directed**:

In an undirected graph, edges do not have any direction associated with them. That is, nodes can be traversed from A to B as well as from B to A. 

In a directed graph, edges form an ordered pair. If there is an edge from A to B, then there is a path from A to B but not from B to A.
